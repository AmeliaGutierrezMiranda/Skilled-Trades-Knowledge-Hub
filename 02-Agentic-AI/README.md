# Series Part 02: Industrial Agentic AI — The "Action-Bot" 🤖🦾

> **AI isn't just for writing emails anymore; it's starting to pick up a wrench.**

## 💡 What is Agentic AI?
Most AI (like ChatGPT) waits for you to ask it a question. **Agentic AI** is different—it is designed to take *action*. 

In a plant setting, an "Agent" doesn't just tell you a part is failing; it checks the inventory, drafts a purchase order, and schedules the maintenance window for you to approve.

## 🚀 For Candidates: The "Human-in-the-Loop" Skill
Recruiters aren't looking for people who can be replaced by AI—they want people who can **manage** AI agents.

### Resume Power-Up:
- **The Old Way:** "Monitored machine sensors."
- **The 2026 Way:** "Supervised **Agentic AI workflows** for predictive maintenance, reducing manual parts-ordering time by 40%."

## 👨‍💼 For Supervisors: Your "Digital Intern"
Think of Agentic AI as a highly efficient intern. It handles the "low-brain" tasks (data entry, scheduling, basic troubleshooting) so your skilled techs can focus on high-level repairs.
