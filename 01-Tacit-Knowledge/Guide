# Series Part 01: Mastering Tacit Knowledge 🛠️

> **The "unwritten" wisdom of the shop floor.**

## 💡 What is Tacit Knowledge?
In the industrial sector, knowledge is split into two types:
1. **Explicit Knowledge:** What you find in manuals, SOPs, and safety checklists.
2. **Tacit Knowledge:** The "gut feeling." It’s knowing exactly how much tension to apply to a bolt or recognizing a machine's "off" sound 2 hours before a sensor triggers an alarm.

## 🚀 For Candidates: Displaying it on your Resume
Recruiters in 2026 aren't just looking for "years of experience"—they want to see your **Institutional Wisdom**. Use the "Tacit-to-Value" formula:

**[Specific Observation] + [Action Taken] = [Business Result]**

### Example:
- **Instead of:** "Experienced in CNC Maintenance."
- **Use:** "Utilized acoustic intuition to identify spindle misalignments before failure, saving $12k in emergency part costs."

## 👨‍💼 For Supervisors: Capturing Knowledge
Don't let 30 years of experience walk out the door when a veteran retires.
- **Shadowing:** Pair "Digital Native" new hires with "Knowledge Holder" veterans.
- **Knowledge Audits:** Regularly ask your leads: *"What is the one thing about this machine that isn't in the manual?"*
- **Video Capture:** Use 30-second phone clips of complex repairs to build a "Digital Tribal Library."
